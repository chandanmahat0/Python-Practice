Problem: Find the Average Marks of a Student
The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

Example
marks key:value pairs are
‘alpha’: [20, 30, 40]
‘beta’: [30, 50, 70]
query_name = ‘beta’

The query_name is ‘beta’.
beta’s average score is (30 + 50 + 70) / 3 = 50.0


Input Format
	•	The first line contains the integer n, the number of student records.
	•	The next n lines contain the student’s name and the marks obtained, each value separated by a space.
	•	The final line contains query_name, the name of a student to query.

Constraints
2 < n < 10
0 < marks[i] < 100
length of marks arrays = 3

Output Format
Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student, correct to 2 decimal places.
